# Icons placeholder

Binary assets are not included in the repository. Place your own icons in this folder using the following filenames so the manifest can pick them up:

- `icon48.png` — 48×48 PNG used for the extension list.
- `icon128.png` — 128×128 PNG used for the Chrome Web Store tile and extension page.

Keep the relative paths unchanged; only drop your PNG files with matching dimensions.
